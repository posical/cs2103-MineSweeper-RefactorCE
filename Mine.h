/** Identifier Naming Convention
 * 
 *      Class Name
 * Pascal Case (aka Upper Camel Case)
 * The first letter of each word should be capitalized
 * All words are concatenated without space or underscore
 * Acronym should be avoided, unless it's very popular (eg. XML)
 * Acronym is treated as one word
 * Digits and underscore should be avoided
 * eg. EntityManager, SoundGenerator, UrlReader
 *
 *      Function Name 
 * Camel Case
 * The first letter of the first word kept lowercase, while the first letter of the subsequent words are capitalized
 * All words are concatenated without space or underscore
 * Acronym should be avoided, unless it's very popular (eg. XML)
 * Acronym is treated as one word
 * Digits and underscore should be avoided
 * Try to name function that queries a boolean value with isXXXX() (eg. isRunning() )
 * eg. run(), onMouseEvent(), getXmlHttpRequest()
 *
 *      Variables
 * Camel Case
 * The first letter of the first word kept lowercase, while the first letter of the subsequent words are capitalized
 * All words are concatenated without space or underscore
 * Private/protected class field should be preceded with underscore
 * The identifier should be mnemonic
 * eg. _vertexBuffer, _context3D
 * 
 *      Constants
 * All uppercase letters
 * Space should be replaced by underscore
 * eg. DEFAULT_FRAME_RATE, SOUND_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE
